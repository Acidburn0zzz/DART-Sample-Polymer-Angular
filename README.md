DART-Sample-PolymerHelloWorld
=============================

A sample to verify a [discussion][1] on DartLang (G+)

JavaScript-Version is [here][2]

<strong>v2.0</strong>
Works with Angular<br>
event-handler is not supported anymore.

<strong>v1.2</strong>
event-handler added.
Now something like this works:
```html
    <event-handler>
        <hello-world></hello-world>
    </event-handler>
```

<strong>v1.1</strong>
Two components communicate with each other via EventBus.<br>
Another approach is to communicate via [shared Model][3].
